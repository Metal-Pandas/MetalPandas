# Metal Pandas Order a Car

Metal Pandas Order a Car will allow users to sign up to get or provide transportation to others. Users will enter data for their 
profile, payment, and area they are providing or using the service. The user will then arrange transportation by adding dates and times, location using google maps, and will provide feedback on how the application could be better.

## History
10/7/2019 This project started out as a GUI with no data base attached. 

10/15/2019 The project is linked to a database with tables. The project also now has a layout for future screens.

10/20/2019 The first prototype is complete with full CSS styling, complete with logic to move between pages and a working login method.

11/09/2019 The beta of our prototype has integrated googlemaps API, a rating system for drivers, additional payment pages and increased 
          database functionality.

12/5/2019 The final beta of our prototype was submitted and shown to the class. Overall the program is mostly functional. Users can now update their profile, schedule a ride, create favorites, add a payment method and pay for a ride. The dark and light theme now work with all the scenes properly. User-friendly error messages now pop up whenever a user enters a wrong credential and when a user leaves a field blank.
